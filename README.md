## E-Commerce API

This API is an e-commerce application built with Ruby on Rails.

## Description

This e-commerce API allows users to interact with product and purchase data. The main components of the API include:

1. **ProductsController**: This controller provides endpoints to retrieve product data. It has two key actions: `top_products`, which might return a list of the most popular or best-selling products, and `top_revenue_products`, likely providing a list of products generating the most revenue.

2. **PurchasesController**: This controller offers endpoints related to purchases. The `index` action likely returns a list of all purchases. The `purchases_by_granularity` action allows querying purchases with certain granularity, possibly for sales analysis purposes.

3. **Authentication**: The API employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for request authentication. This allows the application to securely identify admins and ensure they have proper permissions to perform certain actions.

4. **Tests**: The application comes with a testing suite built with RSpec, a testing framework for Ruby. This suggests adherence to software development best practices as testing helps ensure the application's code works as expected.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the server up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/edcardenash/ecommerce.git
    ```

2. **Change into the new directory**:

    ```
    cd ecommerce
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```
    bundle install
    ```

4. **Setup the database**:

    ```
    rails db:setup
    ```

5. **Start the server**:

    ```
    rails server
    ```

6. **Generate JWT Secret Key**:

    ```
    rake secret
    ```

    Save the generated secret key for JWT in your environment variables as `JWT_SECRET`.
    
 6. **API testing**:


    A Bash script (api_tests.sh) is provided in the root directory to automate these curl requests. Please ensure to update the placeholders for    admin's email and password before running the script.

The application should now be running at `localhost:3000`.

Note: This API is designed to work with Ruby version 2.6.3 and Rails 6.1.0. It may not function as expected with other versions of Ruby and Rails.
